# cartas (cards)

This is just a small project to play around a bit with react. I'm trying to practice a bit of what I'm learning in Kent C Dodds' "Epic React" course.
I might finish this one or not, however there is also an app version I started working at. You can find it over here: https://github.com/vasconsaurus/cartas-app
